It's 5:09 am on Monday. Thanksgiving. I couldn't sleep anymore...I needed to do this class anyway. So today I'm going to see how far into the CSS work I can get before the kid wakes up officially. Here goes number 1.

Took me about ten minutes.

Finished exercise 2. Took me about ten minutes again after I realized that I can just copy the HTML file from Odin's GIT to my own VSCODE.  Hrm.  Anyway. I'm done. On to exercise three.

The third exercise was quick too. I might be able to bang all these out before I have to work this morning. (it's a new day...and it's 4:30 in the morning.)

Onto five!

Onto six...five was...easy.
